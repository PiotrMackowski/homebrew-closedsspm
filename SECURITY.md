# Security Policy

This repository contains only Homebrew formula files that are **automatically generated** by [GoReleaser](https://goreleaser.com/) from the [ClosedSSPM](https://github.com/PiotrMackowski/ClosedSSPM) repository.

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security issue with **ClosedSSPM itself**, please report it via the main repository:

- **GitHub Security Advisories**: https://github.com/PiotrMackowski/ClosedSSPM/security/advisories/new

If you discover an issue with the **Homebrew formula** (e.g., incorrect checksums, tampered URLs), please report it the same way.

**Do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.**
